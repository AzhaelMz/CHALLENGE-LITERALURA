## üì¢ NOTICE

Consider i made this program to practice my knowledge. Maybe you can find errors or improvements, for example i considered get all the options individually for both ways from the API and the Database, neverthless, i don't had the enough time to implement but in a future (not far away xd) i'll make the necessary improvements.

Thanks for the patience.
## üëÄ What you can do?

In this program you can...

- Search a book by title (getting by database or in case is empty from de API.)

- List the books you previously Searched *.

- List authors from the books you previously Searched *.

- List authors alive in the rank of year you write *. 

- List books available in the language you choose *.






*Some data comes from the database except the 1st option "Search a book by title" this option can get data from the API also. Consider search a book first to get all data.
