# üöÄLITERALURA-CHALLENGE-PROJECT

This a challenge-PROJECT of the back-end specialization offered by Alura Latam and Oracle Next Education.




## üßêWhat's the Objective?

This program allow to the user search a book from the API "Gutendex" and save de data of the books like title of the book, author info, language and downloads count. 






## üì¢ NOTICE

Consider i made this program to practice my knowledge. Maybe you can find errors or improvements, for example i considered get all the options individually for both ways from the API and the Database, neverthless, i don't had the enough time to implement but in a future (not far away xd) i'll make the necessary improvements.

Thanks for the patience.
## üëÄ What you can do?

In this program you can...

- Search a book by title (getting by database or in case is empty from de API.)

- List the books you previously Searched *.

- List authors from the books you previously Searched *.

- List authors alive in the rank of year you write *. 

- List books available in the language you choose *.






*Some data comes from the database except the 1st option "Search a book by title" this option can get data from the API also. Consider search a book first to get all data.
## üß∞ Wich technologies i used?
To make this possible i used:

- Java 17 (JDK languge).

- Spring boot (Framework).

- Maven (Dependency magnament tool).

- Postgres (A SQL Database).

## ‚öôÔ∏è App Running
When you run the app you will see the following menu:

There you can choose the option you want to execute.

- For the 1st if you write the name or id od the book you will the following result:

in case the data is not in the database you wil see the following:

when you write again the same id you will get the following result:

- For the 2nd option you will get the list of the books searched previously:

- For the 3rd option you will get the following result:

- For the 4st option you will get:

- For the last (5th option) you will get the list of the books of the language you write (you can use code or string):

Also if you want to verfy the data you can use the Querys from PostgreSQL. You will see like this:

- For books:

-For authors *:

*Some books doesn't have authors and tha is why you probably see "null" in some results.

## ü´° Conclusion 
I'll will add more features in the future because the programming learn is a constantly update. 
The future improvments i'll add i'll be pretty format for the results, sub menus and more...
if you have ideas or improvments, you can ask a pull request for edit. :)
